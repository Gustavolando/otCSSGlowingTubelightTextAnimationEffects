## CSS Glowing Tubelight Text Animation Effect

This is another tiny but also amazing CSS effect animation from the Online Tutorials [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_13a3r6MYeM) I made a few months ago and want to share it here.

This is pure HTML and CSS ONLY!!

I practiced here the contenteditable attribute for the HTML text tags, the -webkit-box-reflect CSS property and a very creative animation style.

I hope you like it, code it and [watch it](https://gustavolando.github.io/otCSSGlowingTubelightTextAnimationEffects/) !
